The GeoQuest project is an interactive geographical quiz game developed using the pygame library in Python. In this game, players are presented with a world map containing various landmarks, and their objective is to identify the location of these landmarks. The game incorporates features such as a main menu with options to start the game, view the leaderboard, and read instructions. Players earn points based on the proximity of their guesses to the actual locations, and the total score is displayed at the end of each round. The project uses external data files, such as "Landmarks.csv" for city coordinates and "Leaderboard.xlsx" for storing player scores. The game provides an engaging and educational experience, challenging players to test their knowledge of global landmarks while competing for a spot on the leaderboard.
